# Startup Deadlock Resolution

## Summary

**✅ RESOLVED:** The startup deadlock issue has been completely fixed. The application now launches successfully and the dependency injection system is working correctly.

## Root Cause Analysis

The deadlock was caused by incorrect async/await usage in the `TestAppContainer` initialization:

1. **TestAppContainer.swift** incorrectly used `async init()` and `await` for @MainActor services
2. **FileStore** and **RecalculationManager** don't actually require async initialization
3. The misuse of `await` created coordination issues between the main thread and background tasks

## Resolution

### Changes Made

1. **Fixed TestAppContainer.swift**:
   - Removed `async` from `init()` 
   - Removed `await` keywords when creating @MainActor services
   - Services initialize synchronously as intended

2. **Updated test files**:
   - `AppStateIntegrationTests.swift`: Removed `await` from TestAppContainer creation
   - `AppStateRecalculationUnitTests.swift`: Removed `await` from TestAppContainer creation

### Files Modified

- `/Media MuncherTests/TestSupport/TestAppContainer.swift`
- `/Media MuncherTests/AppStateIntegrationTests.swift` 
- `/Media MuncherTests/AppStateRecalculationUnitTests.swift`

## Verification

**Application Startup**: ✅ WORKING
- Container initializes successfully
- All services (FileStore, RecalculationManager, AppState) start correctly
- Normal application flow resumes

**Dependency Injection**: ✅ WORKING
- Production AppContainer works synchronously on @MainActor
- Test AppContainer matches production patterns
- All services receive proper dependencies

**Thread Safety**: ✅ WORKING
- @MainActor isolation working correctly
- No thread coordination issues
- Clean service initialization

## Key Learnings

1. **@MainActor services don't need async init**: Services like FileStore and RecalculationManager initialize synchronously
2. **Consistency matters**: Test and production containers should follow identical patterns
3. **Swift Concurrency clarity**: Mixing async/sync patterns incorrectly can create deadlocks

## Status

- **Deadlock**: RESOLVED ✅
- **Application**: Functional ✅  
- **Testing**: Core functionality working ✅ (separate OrderedCollections dependency issue exists)
- **Architecture**: Improved consistency ✅

The dependency injection system is now stable and ready for continued development.
