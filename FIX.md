# FIX.md - Remaining Code Quality Issues

This document outlines the remaining issues found during architectural review that still need to be addressed.

## Issue 10: Code Organization and Documentation

### 10b. Missing API Documentation

**Problem:** Some public interfaces still lack comprehensive documentation

**Current Status:** Significant progress made - DestinationPathBuilder and ThumbnailCache now have excellent documentation

**Remaining Work:**
- `AppError` cases need usage examples
- Some protocol methods may lack parameter descriptions
- Verify 100% coverage across all public APIs

**Solution:**
Complete comprehensive documentation for remaining interfaces:

```swift
/// Domain-specific error types with usage examples
enum AppError: Error {
    /// File system access denied - typically thrown during destination validation
    /// Usage: Catch this error to prompt user for different folder selection
    case accessDenied(String)
    
    /// Import operation failed due to insufficient disk space
    /// Usage: Display user-friendly message with space requirements
    case insufficientSpace(required: Int64, available: Int64)
}
```

## Issue 13: ThumbnailCache Test Isolation

**Problem:** `ThumbnailCacheTests.swift` depends on real QuickLook framework instead of isolated unit tests

**Current Status:** Tests exist but still use real QuickLook framework - functional but not fully isolated

**Risk Level:** Medium
- Tests are slower and less reliable
- Tests depend on file system and QuickLook framework
- No mock injection capability for isolated testing

**Current Implementation:**
- ThumbnailCacheTests.swift:1-105 uses real QuickLook with fake URLs
- ThumbnailPipelineIntegrationTests.swift:1-468 provides comprehensive end-to-end coverage
- Tests work but aren't true isolated unit tests

**Proposed Solution:**
Add dependency injection for thumbnail generation:

```swift
// Current (no injection):
cache = ThumbnailCache(limit: 3)

// Proposed fix - add thumbnail generator injection:
cache = ThumbnailCache(limit: 3, thumbnailGenerator: { url, size in
    // Mock implementation for testing
    return Image(systemName: "photo")
})
```

## ✅ Issue 15: MediaFileCellView Performance Optimization - RESOLVED

**Problem:** `MediaFileCellView.swift` triggered thumbnail loading on every `file.sourcePath` change

**Status:** **COMPLETED** (2025-08-01)

**Solution Implemented:**
- Changed trigger from `.onChange(of: file.sourcePath)` to `.onChange(of: file.thumbnailData)`
- Added direct Data→Image conversion path to avoid unnecessary cache lookups
- Maintained fallback to cache lookup for robustness

**Implementation Details:**
```swift
// BEFORE (inefficient):
.onChange(of: file.sourcePath) { _, _ in
    loadThumbnail()
}

private func loadThumbnail() {
    Task {
        let url = URL(fileURLWithPath: file.sourcePath)
        displayThumbnail = await thumbnailCache.thumbnailImage(for: url)
    }
}

// AFTER (optimized):
.onChange(of: file.thumbnailData) { _, _ in
    loadThumbnail()
}

private func loadThumbnail() {
    Task {
        // Direct conversion if data exists
        if let thumbnailData = file.thumbnailData,
           let nsImage = NSImage(data: thumbnailData) {
            displayThumbnail = Image(nsImage: nsImage)
        } else {
            // Fallback to cache lookup
            let url = URL(fileURLWithPath: file.sourcePath)
            displayThumbnail = await thumbnailCache.thumbnailImage(for: url)
        }
    }
}
```

**Benefits Achieved:**
- Eliminated unnecessary thumbnail reloading during status updates
- Improved UI responsiveness during import operations
- Reduced QuickLook cache pressure
- Maintained backward compatibility and error handling
