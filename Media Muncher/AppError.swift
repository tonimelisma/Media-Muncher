import Foundation

/// Domain-specific error types for Media Muncher operations.
///
/// This enum provides typed error handling across all application services with
/// contextual information for debugging and user-facing error messages.
///
/// ## Usage Examples
/// ```swift
/// // Service throwing errors
/// func scanVolume() async throws -> [File] {
///     guard volumeExists else {
///         throw AppError.scanFailed(reason: "Volume no longer available")
///     }
/// }
///
/// // Error handling with user feedback
/// do {
///     try await importFiles()
/// } catch let error as AppError {
///     await MainActor.run {
///         self.errorMessage = error.localizedDescription
///     }
/// }
/// ```
///
/// ## Error Categories
/// - **Scanning**: Volume access and file discovery errors
/// - **Import**: File copying and verification failures  
/// - **Recalculation**: Destination path update errors
/// - **Configuration**: Missing or invalid settings
enum AppError: Error, Identifiable, LocalizedError {

    /// - Parameter reason: Detailed explanation of the failure for debugging

    /// User has not selected a destination folder in Settings.
    /// This error prevents import operations from proceeding.

    /// - Parameter reason: Detailed explanation of the failure for debugging
    case importFailed(reason: String)

    /// This typically occurs on read-only volumes or due to permission issues.
    /// - Parameter reason: Detailed explanation of the deletion failure
    case importSucceededWithDeletionErrors(reason: String)

    /// - Parameters:
    ///   - source: Source file path that failed to copy
    ///   - reason: Detailed explanation of the copy failure

    /// Failed to create required directory structure in destination.

    ///   - path: Directory path that failed to be created
    ///   - reason: Detailed explanation of the creation failure
    case directoryCreationFailed(path: String, reason: String)
    
    /// Destination path recalculation failed during settings changes.
    /// This can occur when destination becomes unavailable or settings are invalid.
