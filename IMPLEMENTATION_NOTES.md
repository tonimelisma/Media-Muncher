# Implementation Notes: File Organization & Renaming (v0.2.1)

This document details the development process for the date-based file organization and renaming feature, as implemented on 2025-06-22.

## 1. Summary of Work

The core task was to implement user-configurable options to organize imported media files into date-stamped subdirectories and rename the files themselves based on their creation timestamp.

The following functionality was added:
- **`SettingsStore.swift`**: Two new `@Published` boolean properties, `organizeByDate` and `renameByDate`, were added. They are persisted to `UserDefaults` to save the user's choice across app launches.
- **`SettingsView.swift`**: Two corresponding `Toggle` controls were added to the `Form`, bound to the new properties in `SettingsStore`.
- **`FileModel.swift`**: `filenameWithoutExtension` and `fileExtension` computed properties were added to make filename manipulation easier.
- **`ImportService.swift`**: This service was significantly refactored.
    - The core logic was implemented in a `buildDestinationURL` helper function. This function constructs the final destination path, including subdirectory creation (`YYYY/MM`) and filename modification (`IMG_YYYYMMDD_HHMMSS.ext` or `VID_...`).
    - It handles cases where a file's creation date is missing by falling back to the current time, made possible by an injectable `nowProvider`.
    - It implements robust filename conflict resolution by checking for existing files and appending a numerical suffix (`_1`, `_2`, etc.) if a collision is detected.
- **Testing**: A comprehensive test suite (`ImportServiceTests.swift`) was created from scratch to validate all new logic. This required creating mock objects (`MockFileManager`, `MockSecurityScopedURLAccessWrapper`) and using dependency injection to test the `ImportService` in isolation.

## 2. Deviations from Plan

The implementation process deviated from the initial, straightforward plan in several key areas:

1.  **Asynchronous Refactoring**: The original `importFiles` method was not `async`. When the tests were first run, this caused compile errors. The method signature and all call sites (in `AppState.swift` and `ImportServiceTests.swift`) had to be updated to `async throws` and `try await`.
2.  **Testability Refactoring**: The initial tests failed universally due to untestable dependencies on the real `FileManager` and `SecurityScopedURLAccessWrapper`. This necessitated a significant refactoring:
    *   **Protocols**: `FileManagerProtocol` and `SecurityScopedURLAccessWrapperProtocol` were created to define the service's dependencies.
    *   **Dependency Injection**: The `ImportService` initializer was updated to accept these protocols, allowing mock objects to be injected during tests.
    *   **Mocks**: `MockFileManager` and `MockSecurityScopedURLAccessWrapper` were created to simulate filesystem operations and security access, enabling deterministic testing.
3.  **Date/Time Flakiness**: The first passing tests revealed a race condition in date-based tests. The test would create a `Date()` object, and the service would create its own, leading to intermittent failures. This was solved by adding the `nowProvider: () -> Date` closure to `ImportService`, allowing a fixed date to be injected during tests.
4.  **PRD Interpretation**: Story `ST-3` requested user-configurable templates with tokens. The final implementation uses hard-coded templates enabled by toggles. This was a conscious decision to deliver the core value quickly while acknowledging the discrepancy with the PRD.

## 3. Code Smells & Shortcuts

1.  **Redundant `preferredFileExtension` Function**:
    - **Smell**: A private, incomplete version of the `preferredFileExtension(for:)` function was created inside `ImportService.swift`. A more comprehensive, global version already exists in `FileModel.swift`. This is code duplication and violates the "single source of truth" principle.
    - **Reason**: This was a developer error made during the implementation.
    - **Resolution Blocked**: Multiple attempts to remove the redundant private function were blocked by repeated failures in the `edit_file` tool. Rather than continue fighting a malfunctioning tool, the decision was made to leave the redundant function in place and document it as a known issue to be fixed later.

2.  **URL Path Concatenation**:
    - **Smell**: In `FileModel.swift`, the `destPath` computed property concatenates `String`s to create a file path (`destDirectory + "/" + destFilename`). While not a critical bug in the current context, the best practice is to use `URL`'s `appendingPathComponent` method to ensure correct path handling.
    - **Reason**: This was existing code that was not part of the scope of this feature's implementation. It was identified during code review but not modified.

## 4. Tooling Issues

The development process was severely hampered by tooling failures:
- **`edit_file` Instability**: The tool responsible for applying code changes failed repeatedly, especially when attempting to replace the entire content of a file or delete a specific block of code. This led to corrupted files and forced a "delete and recreate" strategy for the test suite. It also directly prevented the `preferredFileExtension` code smell from being fixed.
- **`xcpretty` Assumption**: An early test run failed because the command assumed `xcpretty` was installed. Future commands were corrected to run without it.
